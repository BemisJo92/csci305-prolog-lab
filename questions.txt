16. Name something you like about Prolog. Explain.
	I like that Prolog is a lot different than most of the languages we have worked with before. I have never coded in a language like Prolog before, so it was cool to see how a language like this worked. 

17. Name something you dislike about Prolog. Explain.
	The only thing I didn't like about Prolog, which was minor mind you, was that every time you edited the file, you had to reload it in the interpreter. I looked up maybe a keyboard shortcut to do that, but didn't put too much effort into it. There's probably a way. 
	
18. Did you enjoy this lab? Which aspects did you like and/or dislike?
	I did enjoy this lab! I thought it was a good introduction to prolog, but I wish it went a little deeper and had us create some more complicated rules like in the adventure game in-class example. 

19. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this lab?
	I spent about 5 hours on this lab.
	
20. Do you think you will use Prolog again? For which type(s) or project(s)?
	I don't think I will ever use Prolog again, not because I didn't like it but because I would have no idea what to use it for.
